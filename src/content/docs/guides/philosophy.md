description: The motivation behind Froggit and the principles that guide its design.

Froggit was born out of a simple frustration: Git is powerful, but the command line can feel intimidating especially for people working in teams or those new to development.

Even though Git follows a relatively simple flow modify, stage, commit, push the process can feel overly complicated. It’s easy to forget commands, make mistakes, or feel overwhelmed by the friction of version control.

## Why Froggit Exists

I created Froggit because I wanted something that captured the simplicity of Git core ideas, but made it easier to work with. No stress, no memorization, no fear of breaking something just a fast and intuitive way to manage your work.

Froggit is designed for your **day-to-day Git tasks**. It's not about showing every possible option Git offers it’s about doing the basics really, really well.

## Guiding Principles

- **Keep it simple**: Froggit should always feel easy to use.
- **Focus on the loop**: Stage → Commit → Push. That’s the heart of Git — Froggit embraces it.
- **Be modern**: The terminal doesn’t have to be outdated. Froggit brings modern UX to the command line.
- **Minimize friction**: Actions like staging with the spacebar are designed to be fast and intuitive.
- **Be welcoming**: Froggit is ideal for both newcomers and experienced users who want to move fast.

More advanced tools and features are coming but the core goal will always be the same: **make Git feel effortless**.

> Froggit is not trying to replace Git it’s helping you love using it.
