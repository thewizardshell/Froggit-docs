Froggit is built to be intuitive and keyboard-friendly. Here's how to move around the different sections:

## Main views

Froggit consists of several key views:

- **Files** – shows the list of modified files in your repository.
- **Commit** – write your commit message and confirm.
- **Branches** – list and switch between branches.
- **Remotes** – view and manage remote repositories.
- **Push/Pull** – quickly push or pull from your remote.
- **Fetch** – update your local repo with remote changes.

## Global controls

- `q`: Exit Froggit at any time.
- `r`: Refresh the current view.
- `↑/↓`: Navigate through list items.
- `Esc`: Go back or cancel the current input.
