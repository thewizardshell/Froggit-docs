Froggit is a terminal-based Git assistant written in Go that makes staging, committing, pushing, and switching branches easier and more interactive.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Froggit on your system:

### 1. Download the latest release

Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/your-username/froggit/releases) and download the binary for your operating system.

- **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  chmod +x froggit
  sudo mv froggit /usr/local/bin

* **Windows**:
  Download the `.exe` file and optionally add it to your PATH.

### 2. Using `go install` (for developers)

You can also install Froggit directly from the source if you have Go installed:

```bash
go install github.com/your-username/froggit@latest
```

Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` to use the `froggit` command globally.

### 3. Verify installation

Once installed, run:

```bash
froggit --help
```

You should see a list of available commands and options.
